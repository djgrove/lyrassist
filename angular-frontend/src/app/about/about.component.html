<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  LyrAssist was created by <a href="http://devongrove.com">Devon Grove</a>.Artist bios and images are graciously provided by
  <a href="https://last.fm">Last.fm's</a> API, and lyrics data courtesy of <a href="https://genius.com">Genius</a>.
</p>

<p>
  As of now, all artist lyrics are generated using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_model">Markov model</a>,
  though in the future I will be looking to introduce alternate models for more accurate lyrics. I will be adding functionality
  and new artists on an ongoing basis, so check back for new content soon!
