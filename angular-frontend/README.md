# Lyriqa

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.3.

## Setting up local environment with Docker

Typically you would run `ng serve` for a dev server, but to keep things all packaged nicely, this project is managed by Docker. To build and run an instance of the server, simply run:

`docker-compose up -d`

This will give you a dev environment on localhost port 80. You can still edit the project source as you would normally.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Deployment building

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
